	"content": "These potatoes will blow your mind in rich taste and easiness to prepare. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter the hurry, I guarantee once you try these you\u0026rsquo;ll find time to prepare them even for a mealprep.\nIngredients  4-5 big potatoes (preferably Jacked since we\u0026rsquo;ll eat the skin too) 1 sweet potato (optional) Olive oil Salt Oregano Rosemary (dried) Thyme Parsley Basil Crushed pepper (optional)  Kitchen utensils  Chopping board Chopping knife Fish slice (spatula) A bowl where you can fit at least half of the chopped potatoes (I prefer glass) Baking tray Thick aluminum foil  Preparation  In the bowl:  Pour 4 spoons of olive oil 1/2 teaspoon of oregano 1/2 teaspoon of thyme 1/2 teaspoon of rosemary 1/2 teaspoon of thyme 1/2 teaspoon of parsley 1/2 teaspoon of basil 1/2 teaspoon of salt 1 teaspoon of crushed pepper (optional)   Mix all ingredients in the bowl with a spoon Wash the potatoes and the sweet potato (if any)  Just use your hands and water for this   On the chopping board, chop the potatoes as follows:  In half through longest side Each half, in half again through longest side (they should look like this) Use your judgement to slice each quarter, I like to chop them in small triangles: they should be easy to eat without need of cutting with a knife, but not too small   Place aluminium foil in baking tray Preheat oven: 5 mins at 180 C with fan (or 190 C without fan) Place cut potatoes in the bowl, mix with the ingredients, and place them in the baking tray (repeat until all potatoes are in the tray). Try to cook everything in one go Place baking tray in oven and start cooking: 25 minutes at 180 C with fan (or 190 C without fan) At the end of the time, prick the potatoes with a fork and confirm they\u0026rsquo;re soft. If this is not the case give it a bit extra time Turn off oven and enjoy those amazing potatoes!  "
